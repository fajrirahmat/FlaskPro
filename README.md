# FlaskPro
Entertainment project to spend my boring time.:D

To run this script, I suggest to create virtual environment on your system to
avoid anything that to be not intended happen. After that, follow this step:
1. install Flask, you can see tutorial from http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/installation .
it also provides how to build virtual environment for your workspace. Before
you are able to do that, you must install python first.
2. For tutorial, you can visit http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/tutorial .
   (sorry if it doesn't help.. :P)
