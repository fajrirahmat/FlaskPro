# FlaskPro
Entertainment project to spend my boring time.:D

To run this script, I suggest to create virtual environment on your system to
avoid anything that to be not intended happen. After that, follow this step:

1. install Flask, you can see tutorial from http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/installation .
it also provides how to build virtual environment for your workspace. Before
you are able to do that, you must install python first.

2. For tutorial, you can visit http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/tutorial . (sorry if it doesn't help.. :P)

I will explain each files.

1. manage.py
This file like its name, is used only to run main.py. You need to install Flask-script extension to run this script. You can use <source>pip install Flask-script</source> to install this extension.
2. other files
Actually, I want to explain others. Unfortunately, I have no more time now so I'will explain it later(hopefully..:P).
